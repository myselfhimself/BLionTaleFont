# How to - letter stamps making from BLionTale

Writter all characters that you would like to have as stamps into a LibreOffice document. Save to PDF.
Import PDF into Inkscape with Cairo path converting mode on. (otherwise it fails to print BLionTale character fonts correctly, especially the christmas tree, heart etc.. symbols).

Engrave onto rubber in stamp mode (eg. flipped).
Optionally use a set of cookie-letters stamps or fimo-letter stamps, and stick each rubber letter onto a cookie-letter topmost surface. This will help you in seizing each letter and pressing. In succh cookie or fimo kits, you have a little rail to align letters, this can be useful if you have repeated words for your projects (biscuits packaging..).
